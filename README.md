# machine_learning_final_project
UW-Madison ECE532 final project 

Applied least square (LS) method, support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) on CIFAR10 dataset. 

Poor performance on both LS and NN meethods, about 10% accuracy. 

Okay performance for SVM: 29.7% for linear kernel and 32.6% for polynomial kernel.
