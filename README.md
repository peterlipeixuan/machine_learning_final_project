# machine_learning_final_project
UW-Madison ECE532 final project 
I choose CIFAR-10 dataset as my project subject. The dataset consists of 60000 32-by-32-inch color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The labels of classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. The ratio between number of training and test images is 5-to-1. 

Algorithms weâ€™ve covered so far are linear regression, K-means clustering. I think we are going to cover neural networks later. I am interested in using these three algorithms to process images in the dataset. 

I plan to explore linear regression and K-means clustering to the dataset in the next two weeks. I hope to get comfortable with GitHub and manipulating those two methods by the first update deadline, which is Nov 17th. Before the second update deadline, which is Dec 1st, I want to finish up applying the third method to the dataset. Then leave the rest of semester with troubleshooting, peer reviewing, and report writing.
